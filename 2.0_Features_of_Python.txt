Features are the facilities or services provided by language developer to the programmer/developer
for developing real time application.

Below is the list of feature:
----------------------------
1. Simple
>> Rich set of API'services (API's -> Collection of Modules | Module -> Collection of variable,class & methods)
>> Inbuilt facility of "Garbage Collector" 
   It is a program running in background whose role is collecting unused memory space & improve performance.
>> User-Friendly Syntax

2. Freeware & Open Source
   Freeware : s/w is free.
   Open Source :  Some Company came forward and customized Python called "Distribution of Python"
                   JPYTHON/ANACONDA PYTHON/RUBY PYTHON

3. Platform Independent
   A language is said to be platform Independent if & only if it's program run on any OS without considering its vendor.
   C programming : whose datatypes takes different memory space 
   JAVA programming : whose datatypes takes same memory space & same goes with Python.

4. Dynamic Typed Programming
  In Context programming language, we have 2 types
    >> Static Typed PL :: In Static Typed PL, It is mandatory for programmer to specify the data type otherwise we will have compile time error.
    >> Dynamically Typed PL :: In Dynamically Typed PL, the language runtime environment will decide the data type of the value assigned by the programmer.

5. High Level PL
  >> Low level PL : In Low level PL, we represent the data in the form of binary, octal or hex which is understandable by machine but not by human.
                    Closer to Hardware, Examples such as X86, ARM, MIPS
  >> High Level PL : In High Level PL,low level PL data representation is automatically converted into HLL understandable format. i.e Decimal Number System

6. Robust
   >> It is robust(strong) coz of programming feature called Exception Handling.
   >> Runtime errors of program are called exception, Exception always give technical error messages which are understandable by programmer but not by application user 
   >> Process of converting technical error message into user friendly error message is called exception handling.

7. Extensible
   >> Python PL giving its PL facilities to other language & hence extensible.
   >> You can extend python by writing code in other language like C/C++ & integrate in your python application.

8. Embedded
   >> Python PL can call other language coding segment for faster execution purpose. for ex : Python code can call C programming language.
   >> Its often used as glue language for integration & automation with embedded systems.

9. Support Third Party API's  :: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit, Matplotlib
